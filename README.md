# LLRPexplorer
LLRP explorer for android OS.
LLRP is a "low level" protocol between software and a reader. LLRP provides very fine control over the operation of a single reader. It composed of almost 100 standard commands and provides an interface to low level functionality that is uniform across different reader vendors. Reader vendors donâ€™t have to throw away their existing vendor-specific command language. Instead, many reader vendors support LLRP commands in parallel with their vendor-specific interface. If middleware or application software uses the LLRP interface, portability will be increased.
